## Thoughts going into the class

  Going into Spring 2022 as my second to last semester, I had gotten most of my credits and all I needed were upper division credits. When looking for ICS 400+ electives on STAR, this was once of the few classes that stood out to me, mainly because it was regarded as an easy A. The class was described as a continuation of 314, which was another class that I enjoyed. It was one of the few classes where the instructor's infectious enthusiasm pushed me to grow to enjoy the content of the course. Revisiting things like Meteor and React was something that I was looking forward to since I enjoyed recreating websites and their components before, but I knew it needed to take time. 

## First Impressions

  Having the structure of the class explained by the professor of the course, Cam Moore, the class was seemed more fun than it did initially. ICS 414 would essenstially be a semester-long version of the final project for 314 where we collaborate with others to create a website, but instead of a website for a service for the university, it would be a website for a customer's vision of what they want their website to look like. Professor Moore reassured my thoughts by saying that the class was indeed an easy A, but having out website be judged by the customers seemed even heavier than a grade. More than an easy A, hearing that an internship might be up for grabs for teams that do well seemed to be a much better incentive for creating a polished product. 

## Meeting the Customers

  About 2 days after forming teams within the class, we got into a zoom call with the customers, Scott, Nancy, and Malindi, where they introduced themselves and their vision for the website. They were very nice and a pleasure to work with. Throughout the semester we had a couple of meetings with them to check on the progress of our websites. Generally, the feedback was positive and there were rarely any instances where they heavily opposed something like a page, component, etc. If I could wish for anything, I would have wanted them to be a bit more specific with their requests, but flexibility and need for imagination was part of the challenge, and making it more specific would make the project no different than a homework assignment.
