## Thoughts going into the class

  Going into Spring 2022 as my second to last semester, I had gotten most of my credits and all I needed were upper division credits. When looking for ICS 400+ electives on STAR, this was once of the few classes that stood out to me, mainly because it was regarded as an easy A. The class was described as a continuation of 314, which was another class that I enjoyed. It was one of the few classes where the instructor's infectious enthusiasm pushed me to grow to enjoy the content of the course.
